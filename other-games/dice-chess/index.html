<h3>Set up</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Take a standard chess board.</li>
    <li>Player 1 takes 16 D6 of one color.</li>
    <li>Player 2 takes 16 D6 of a distinctly different color.</li>
    <li>Each player rolls all of their dice.</li>
    <li>Once rolled, place them on the board as if they were chess pieces, filling up the back two rows of the chess board on opposing sides from each other.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Play</h3>
<h4>Moves</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Players take turns moving dice. They may move 1 die per turn.</li>
    <li>Dice may only move forward, back left or right. Dice showing a value of 6 may move any direction including diagonals.</li>
    <li>Dice showing a value of 2-6 may move 1 square per turn. Dice showing a value of 1 may move 2 squares.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Capture</h4>
<ul>
    <li>A player may capture an opponent’s die by moving onto the opponent’s square with a die that shows an equal or higher value.</li>
    <ul><li>For example, a die showing a value of 2 may take an opponent’s die that shows a value of one or two, but not a die that shows three or higher.</li></ul>
    <li>When a player captures an opponent’s die that die is removed from the game and placed near the player who captured it, still showing its value when it was captured (you might need this info later on.)</li>
    <li>When a player captures an opponent’s die he or she must then reroll the die that made the capture and place it in the square that was just taken.</li>
    <ul><li>For example, player 1 has a die that shows a value of 3 he moves one space forward and takes his opponents die that shows a value of 2. The opponent’s die is removed from the game and player 1 rerolls his die, placing it in the square formerly owned by his opponent.</li></ul>
</ul>

<h3>Winning</h3>
<ul>
    <li>When one of the following occurs, the game ends:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Only one player has dice on the board. They are the winner.</li>
        <li>Neither player has made an effective play for more than two turns. For example, just chasing each other around the board, unable to make a capture.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>In this case, then the player with the highest dice total left on the board wins.</li>
            <li>If the game is still a tie, then the player with the highest total value of captured dice captured is the winner.</li>
            <li>If there is still draw, the game is declared a draw.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
</ul>
