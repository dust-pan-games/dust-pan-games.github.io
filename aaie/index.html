---
<p><i>The warrior digs ditches for a livin’, the wizard’s got an eye on his elbow and knows maybe two words of magic, the thief’s only here 'cause he owes 500 gold pieces to Shifty Pete, and the priest worships something she calls Cho-sugroth, the Mother of Pain. I shoulda taken that job washing dishes down the pub</i></p>
<p>In most fantasy roleplaying games, you take on the role of a competent, experienced adventurer, ready and willing to take on whatever challenges the world can throw at you in the name of defeating evil and acquiring loot.</p>
<p>This is not one of those games.</p>
<p><i>Amazing Adventurers and Incredible Exploits</i>, by contrast, throws you into the shoes of an inexperienced and woefully unprepared schmuck as they embark on their first ever adventure. Character creation is quick and easy, allowing you to roll up a character fast and get into the game. GMing is easy as well; <i>AAIE</i> provides tools for randomly generating plot hooks, monsters, equipment, and the many fumbles and misfires the party will invariably visit on themselves. It's the perfect game for those nights when you just want something that’ll make you laugh, cry, and wonder exactly why someone decided to bring bagpipes on a dungeon crawl.</p>
