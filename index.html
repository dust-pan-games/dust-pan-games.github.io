<p>Welcome to Dust Pan Games!</p>
<p>Here youâ€™ll find our first offering to the gaming public, <i>Amazing Adventures &amp; Incredible Exploits</i>, a beer-and-pretzels RPG about under-prepared adventurers on their first dungeon delve!</p>
<p>The <i>AAIE</i> rules are available for download under the <a href="http://www.dustpangames.com/aaie/files">Files</a> section. Sample characters are also available.</p>
<p>Under <a href="http://www.dustpangames.com/videos">Videos</a>, you'll find videos of our playtest group playing a full game from character generation to conclusion to demonstrate just how easy (and fun!) the game can be.</p>
<p>Also available: a toolkit on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dustpangames.aaie_tools">Google Play</a> for both GMs and players, allowing you to randomly generate almost anything in the game on the fly, from player characters to deities to combat fumbles!</p>
<p>You will probably need that last one a lot.</p>
